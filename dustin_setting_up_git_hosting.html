            <h1>Github for hosting websites?</h1>

            <p>
                Now that I had a basic idea of how HTML works and how to format with CSS it was time for me to put it into 
                practice, just one problem how do more people besides me see it? That is where Github Pages comes in. To host a page
                on it is super easy. You start up a repo... thats about it. 
                You can go to settings -> pages and it will tell you if it is hosted or not. It only works with static pages though 
                and defaults to index.html as your home page.
            </p>
            <div id="github"></div>
            <p>
                If you would like to host on Github as well its quite easy, look up a how to on Youtube and any of the 
                first 5 should be able to help you out.
