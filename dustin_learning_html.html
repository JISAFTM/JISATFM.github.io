                This week I focused on trying to improve my knowledge of Front end work flows. 
                This started with learning some HTML so that I would be able to understand all of the flow in the UI. 
                I used Codecademy as my main source of knowledge for this work.

                It was a fun class and taught me the basics of HRML, but the biggest things it taught me were that HTML is just 
                text and links with lots a labels, not that I would know about why till the following day, and that HTML by itself looks bland.
