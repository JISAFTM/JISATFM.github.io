                For my second and third day this week I focused on learned CSS. This opened up a new world for UI 
                development for me. No longer did my pages look like a text doc, now they looked like a highschoolers 
                CSS project! As I learned CSS all of the labels in HTML made more and more sense to me and I decided when it
                doubt to add ids, it makes it much easier later.

                When learning about CSS I found a video that taught me about the CSS logo. The color in the logo is named 
                <a id="rebecca_purple" href="https://medium.com/@valgaze/the-hidden-purple-memorial-in-your-web-browser-7d84813bb416" target="_blank">RebeccaPurple</a>
                and if you have time I have linked a video explaining its importants.
